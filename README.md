# dot_file

This repo. contains a bunch of files I need for my Linux. My mainly usage 
of Linux is to write LaTex with Vim, so my goal is to build my Vim into a LaTex 
IDE oriented, and I am very satisfied so far. 

Linux Distribution: Arch Linux

## LaTex
Download all the LaTex packages. 

On GNU/Linux
On Debian-based distros (Ubuntu/Linux Mint):  
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```
For Arch-based distros (Manjaro, Parabola, Antergos):
```shell
$ sudo pacman -S texlive-most texlive-lang
```
